<h1 id="identify-statement">Identify Statement</h1>
<p>Software developers need ways to do work when they are away from their desktop computer because I think it’s common for developers to need to get work done when they are separated from their development environment.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-know-this-is-a-problem">How do I know this is a problem?</h1>
<p>It’s fairly common for someone to need to access a computer remotely, for development or otherwise. 
A significant amount of production code is not hosted on-site, but rather on a cloud computing service like AWS, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, etc. 
Traditionally this would be accomplished using a tool called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>, which allows a user to safely and securely open a terminal on a remote computer. 
<img src="/assets/img/ssh_in_use.jpg" alt="An example of SSH in use" title="SSH in use" />
However, the use of a terminal requires the user to use terminal-compatible tools, such as Vim, rather than a graphical environment most developers would be comfortable with. 
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments">According to the StackOverflow 2019 Developer Survey</a>, only 25.4% of responders were familiar with Vim, the most popular terminal development software.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-i-care">Why do I care?</h1>
<p>All of my development is done on a large desktop PC. 
Every weekend, I go to my mom’s house, where I no longer have access to my PC. 
The only portable computer I have is a school-provided chromebook, which is locked down and not suitable for development. 
Having a way to remotely connect to my PC would allow me to work on my side projects wherever I have my chromebook, with the computing resources of a full sized desktop PC.</p>
