# Identify Statement
Software developers need ways to do work when they are away from their desktop computer because I think it's common for developers to need to get work done when they are separated from their development environment.

# How do I know this is a problem?
It’s fairly common for someone to need to access a computer remotely, for development or otherwise. 
A significant amount of production code is not hosted on-site, but rather on a cloud computing service like AWS, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, etc. 
Traditionally this would be accomplished using a tool called `ssh`, which allows a user to safely and securely open a terminal on a remote computer.

However, the use of a terminal requires the user to use terminal-compatible tools, such as Vim, rather than a graphical environment most developers would be comfortable with. 
[According to the StackOverflow 2019 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments), only 25.4% of responders were familiar with Vim, the most popular terminal development software.

# Why do I care?
All of my development is done on a large desktop PC. 
Every weekend, I go to my mom’s house, where I no longer have access to my PC. 
The only portable computer I have is a school-provided chromebook, which is locked down and not suitable for development. 
Having a way to remotely connect to my PC would allow me to work on my side projects wherever I have my chromebook, with the computing resources of a full sized desktop PC.
